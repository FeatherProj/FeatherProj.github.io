            <h5 class="semibold-text">Q1. What is this project?</h5>
            <hr />
            <p>Starlight Paradise (Formerly known as Hyper Warfare, Ah_Roon's Paradise) is the collection of community server projects which aims to be gameplay focused and less bloats such as cosmetics and advertisements.</p>
        </div>
        <div style="margin-top: 50px;">
            <h5 class="semibold-text">Q2. History regarding of this project?</h5>
            <hr />
            <p>When I was middle school student, I began to working on the project since 2016 and it was supposed to be Minecraft Flan's Mod server project. However, the project was scrapped in 2017 due to popularity and Oracle's Java SDK policy changes.</p>
            <p>After long break until 2018, the project was rebranded as Source Engine server project, but expanded to support more games in the future. After Roon visited many community servers, they were mostly have strict rules, unfriendly community and more bloats even without focusing on gameplay. And of course I looked into several community server's criticism on wiki and several places, this helped me to be more experienced about managing community server.</p>
            <p>After seeing this painful experience through several gameplay server, we decided to make our own several community servers and expand to support more games in the future.</p>
        </div>
        <div style="margin-top: 50px;">
            <h5 class="semibold-text">Q3. When will this be released?</h5>
            <hr />
            <p>When it's available. Currently I would like to host server then turn it to early access when available but it costs 40$ every year and also it costs 11$ for every month. So we cannot afford that server maintenence fee right now...</p>
            <p>If you want to support our work to help the project keep running, here you can use our <a href="https://patreon.com/mysticmoonlight" target="_blank">patreon</a>> to support us.</p>
        </div>
        <div style="margin-top: 50px;">
            <h5 class="semibold-text">Q4. Is there any branch for this project?</h5>
            <hr />
            <p>Yes, there will be 3 following branches to ensure that server is stable and prevent future crashes in the future:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Labs - Testing server, really unstable to be public. The server is password protected by default.</li>
                <li>Early Access - Pre-release version, but it is open to public for everyone.</li>
                <li>Stable - Official release version, it should be more stable.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We always focus on testing new feature before adding new one.</p>
        </div>
        <div style="margin-top: 50px;">
            <h5 class="semibold-text">Q5. How does this community works?</h5>
            <hr />
            <p>We aims to be less strict and friendly community, so peoples can enjoy playing games and talk with others, while not being stressed about nitpicky things. Also we prefer being horizontal, like Valve corporation. Think about it, most people is also one of the player in the game, and one of staff members. </p>
            <p>We prefer not to force moderator to be strict and enjoy playing the game together with normal players and deal with rule breakers regarding of any role as staff member.</p>
            <p>So in a nutshell: Role is meaningless, we are here to enjoy the game.</p>
        </div>
        <div style="margin-top: 50px;">
            <h5 class="semibold-text">Q6. But then how will you get revenue without any ads?</h5>
            <hr />
            <p>We prefer best experience, so we did not included any advertisement, even on in-game. Instead, we will make the donation optional while making features available to everyone :)</p>
            <p>However, we need your support to keep our project alive! If you want to support our project, <a href="https://patreon.com/mysticmoonlight" target="_blank">here is the way to support us</a>.</p>

        <div style="margin-top: 50px;">
            <h5 class="semibold-text">Q7. What is 'gameplay focused'? Does that mean most update is focused on gameplay changes?</h5>
            <hr />
            <p>Yes, while keeping the original gameplay, we will try to provide improvement if you don't like some features that existed in the game. If you have feedback about improvement, feel free to do so then we will consider more about that!</p>

            <h5 class="semibold-text">Q8. Do I need to download assets for long time?</h5>
            <hr />
            <p>No, not really! But if you're playing on MvM server, or several custom gamemode server, it uses custom maps and assets so it will take long time to download, but not very much. It won't take so long, so please be patient while downloading assets :)</p>
            <p>However compared with other community server, the download won't take so long since we don't have any server side cosmetics.</p>
            <p>I will try to provide asset pack for faster download, if many community member wants it!</p>
