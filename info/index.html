        <h1><b>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</b></h1>
        <h3><b>Q) History regarding of this project?</b></h3>
        <p>When I was middle school student, I began working on the project since 2016 using Minecraft Flan's Mod. However, the project was scrapped in 2017 due to popularity and Oracle's Java SDK policy changes.</p>
        <p>After long break until 2018, the project was rebranded as Source Engine server project, but expanded to support more games in the future. After Roon visited many community servers, they were mostly have strict rules, unfriendly community and more bloats even without focusing on gameplay. And also, I looked into several community server's criticism on several places(Such as threads, wiki, etc.), this helped me getting more experiences when managing community server.</p>
        <p>After seeing this painful experience through several gameplay server, we decided to make our own several community servers and expand to support more games in the future.</p>
        <p>However around autumn of 2021, we decided to cancel the project due to financial issue and taking our time to make decision due to increasement of cheaters and bots on several PvP gamemodes.</p>
        <p>On December 11 2021, we finally decided to shift focus on Co-op and PvE gamemodes but with same concept with our past project, since these gamemode has less chance to meet the cheaters in-game and helps many people to enjoy the game together without competing with other players.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h3><b>Q) When will be released?</b></h3>
        <p>We have no set release date, but we are waiting for financial issue to be solved so we can start working on this project.</p>
